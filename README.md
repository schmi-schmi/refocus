## File Structure

```
refocus/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html         # Main HTML file with todo component (frontend-only)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ css/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css     # All styling including todo styles
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ img/               # Carousel images
```

## Image Categories for Carousel

You can organize images by category and have each carousel item randomly use an image from its category.

How it works:
- Each carousel item in `index.html` has an optional `category` field (e.g. `cats`, `plants`).
- A `categoryImages` map defines available images per category.
- On each load, an image is randomly chosen from the relevant category.

To add your own categories/images:
1. Create folders like `img/cats`, `img/plants`, etc., or keep images in `img/`.
2. Add your image paths to the `categoryImages` map in `index.html`.
3. Ensure the carousel item has `category: '<your-category>'`.

Example snippet in `index.html`:

```javascript
const categoryImages = {
  cats: [
    './img/cats/cat1.jpg',
    './img/cats/cat2.jpg'
  ],
  plants: [
    './img/plants/green1.jpg'
  ]
};

const carouselData = [
  { title: 'Feline Therapy', description: '...', category: 'cats' },
  { title: 'Care for your babies', description: '...', category: 'plants' }
];
```

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage (no setup required)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with glassmorphism effects

## Development

The application is purely client-side:
- **Client**: Manages UI state, storage, and user interactions
- **Storage**: Persistent in localStorage with soft delete capability and weekly reset
